{"cells":[{"source":"When factoring heat generation required for the manufacturing and transportation of products, _Greenhouse gas emissions attributable to products, from food to sneakers to appliances, make up more than 75% of global emissions._ -[The Carbon Catalogue](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01178-9)\n\nOur data, which is publicly available on [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01178-9), contains product carbon footprints (PCFs) for various companies. PCFs are the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to a given product, measured in CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide equivalent).\n\nThis data is stored in a PostgreSQL database containing one table, `prouduct_emissions`, which looks at PCFs by product as well as the stage of production that these emissions occurred. Here's a snapshot of what `product_emissions` contains in each column:\n\n### `product_emissions`\n\n| field                              | data type |\n|------------------------------------|-----------|\n| `id`                                 | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `year`                               | `INT`       |\n| `product_name`                       | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `company`                            | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `country`                            | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `industry_group`                     | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `weight_kg`                          | `NUMERIC`   |\n| `carbon_footprint_pcf`               | `NUMERIC`   |\n| `upstream_percent_total_pcf`         | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `operations_percent_total_pcf`       | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `downstream_percent_total_pcf`       | `VARCHAR`   |\n\nYou'll use this data to examine the carbon footprint of each industry in the dataset!","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6"},"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"SELECT industry_group,\n\t   COUNT(DISTINCT company) AS num_companies,\n\t   ROUND(SUM(carbon_footprint_pcf), 1) AS total_industry_footprint\nFROM product_emissions\nWHERE year IN (SELECT MAX(year) FROM product_emissions)\nGROUP BY industry_group\nORDER BY total_industry_footprint DESC;","metadata":{"customType":"sql","dataFrameVariableName":"carbon_emissions_by_industry","sqlCellMode":"query","sqlSource":{"integrationId":"89e17161-a224-4a8a-846b-0adc0fe7a4b1","type":"integration"},"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":877,"lastExecutedAt":1700934640420,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"SELECT industry_group,\n\t   COUNT(DISTINCT company) AS num_companies,\n\t   ROUND(SUM(carbon_footprint_pcf), 1) AS total_industry_footprint\nFROM product_emissions\nWHERE year IN (SELECT MAX(year) FROM product_emissions)\nGROUP BY industry_group\nORDER BY total_industry_footprint DESC;","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":205,"type":"dataFrame"}}},"id":"f76f5039-ed23-424e-84e7-143d44331a05","cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"industry_group","type":"string"},{"name":"num_companies","type":"integer"},{"name":"total_industry_footprint","type":"number"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":{"index":[0,1,2,3,4,5],"industry_group":["Materials","Capital Goods","Technology Hardware & Equipment","Food, Beverage & Tobacco","Commercial & Professional Services","Software & Services"],"num_companies":[3,2,4,1,1,1],"total_industry_footprint":[107129,94942.7,21865.1,3161.5,740.6,690]}},"total_rows":6,"truncation_type":null}},"metadata":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"isPreview":true}},"execution_count":3,"@datacamp/metadata":{"executedQuery":"WITH datacamp_workspace__user_query AS (\n  SELECT industry_group,\n  \t   COUNT(DISTINCT company) AS num_companies,\n  \t   ROUND(SUM(carbon_footprint_pcf), 1) AS total_industry_footprint\n  FROM product_emissions\n  WHERE year IN (SELECT MAX(year) FROM product_emissions)\n  GROUP BY industry_group\n  ORDER BY total_industry_footprint DESC\n)\n\nSELECT * FROM datacamp_workspace__user_query LIMIT 100","executedQueryParameters":[]}}]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
